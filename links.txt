How to cache bundle install with Docker <===
Also the start command for the app container lives at
/script/start, it is a very simple bash script that first
calls bundle check (kudos @sobrinho for this tip!) to check
if all dependencies are already satisfied and if not calls
bundle install; also brings up the Rails app:
#!/bin/bash
bundle check || bundle install
bundle exec rails s -b 0.0.0.0
