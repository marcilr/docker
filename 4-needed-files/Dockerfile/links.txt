How CircleCI Works
Automate your pipeline from commit to deploy
o VCS Integration
  CircleCI integrates with GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket.
  Every time you commit code, CircleCI creates a build.
o Automated Testing
  CircleCI automatically tests your build in a clean container or
  virtual machine.
o Notifications
  Your team is notified if a build fails so issues can be fixed
  quickly.
o Automated Deployment
  Passing builds are deployed to various environments so your
  product goes to market faster.
