parent image - An image’s parent image is the image designated
  in the FROM directive in the image’s Dockerfile.  All
  subsequent commands are applied to this parent image.  A
  Dockerfile with no FROM directive has no parent image,
  and is called a base image.

VOLUME - A volume is a specially-designated directory within
  one or more containers that bypasses the Union File System.
  Volumes are designed to persist data, independent of the
  container’s life cycle.  Docker therefore never automatically
  delete volumes when you remove a container, nor will it
  "garbage collect" volumes that are no longer referenced by a
  container. Also known as: data volume

  There are three types of volumes: host, anonymous, and named:

  o A host volume lives on the Docker host’s filesystem and
    can be accessed from within the container.

  o A named volume is a volume which Docker manages where on
    disk the volume is created, but it is given a name.

  o An anonymous volume is similar to a named volume, however,
    it can be difficult, to refer to the same volume over time
    when it is an anonymous volumes. Docker handle where the
    files are stored.
