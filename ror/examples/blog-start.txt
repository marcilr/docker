Start the blog web server[1]


1. Change to blog directory
$ cd blog

2. Install Node.js to resolve Ruby on Rails javascript dependency:

$ aptitude install curl
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
...
## Run `apt-get install nodejs` (as root) to install Node.js v6.x LTS Boron and npm
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
...
Preparing to unpack .../nodejs_6.13.1-1nodesource1_amd64.deb ...
Unpacking nodejs (6.13.1-1nodesource1) ...
Setting up nodejs (6.13.1-1nodesource1) ...
Processing triggers for man-db (2.7.6.1-2) ...
$

3. Create javascript symlimk to Node.js node binary:
Had to create symlink for /usr/bin/node to /usr/local/bin/javascript
for javascript binary to be resolved:

$ cd /usr/local/bin
# ln -s /usr/bin/javascript javascript
$ type javascript
javascript is /usr/local/bin/javascript
$


4. Start web server
You actually have a functional Rails application already.
To see it, you need to start a web server on your development
machine. You can do this by running the following in the blog
directory:

$ type rails
rails is hashed (/usr/local/bin/rails)
$

$ cd ~/git/virtualization/docker/ror/examples/blog/
$ rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.1.5 application starting in development 
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.11.3 (ruby 2.3.3-p222), codename: Love Song
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop


5. Access web server:
Chrome access to 0.0.0.0:3000 or http://localhost:3000/ displays:
  Rails
  Yay! Youâ€™re on Rails!
  Rails version: 5.1.5
  Ruby version: 2.3.3 (x86_64-linux-gnu)
