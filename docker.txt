Docker - Build, Ship, and Run Any App, Anywhere

Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build,
ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data
center VMs, or the cloud.
--docker.com/

Docker is hotter than hot because it makes it possible to get far
more apps running on the same old servers and it also makes it
very easy to package and ship programs.
--zdnet.com/

Docker provides this same capability without the overhead of a
virtual machine.  It lets you put your environment and configuration
into code and deploy it.  The same Docker configuration can also be
used in a variety of environments.  This decouples infrastructure
requirements from the application environment.

=============================
Yesterday the GCI NIT MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)
updated to:
  Docker 17.12.0-ce
  Docker compose 1.18.0
  Docker Machine 0.13.0
  Linux Kernel 4.9.60

Community Edition (CE) vs. Enterprise Edition (EE)
==================================================
Docker is available in two editions: Community Edition (CE)
and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Docker Community Edition (CE) is ideal for developers and
small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting
with container-based apps.  Docker CE has two update channels,
stable and edge:

o Stable gives you reliable updates every quarter
o Edge gives you new features every month

For more information about Docker CE, see Docker Community Edition.[1]

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) is designed for enterprise development
and IT teams who build, ship, and run business critical applications
in production at scale. For more information about Docker EE, including
purchasing options, see Docker Enterprise Edition.[2]
