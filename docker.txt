=============================
Yesterday the GCI NIT MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)
updated to:
  Docker 17.12.0-ce
  Docker compose 1.18.0
  Docker Machine 0.13.0

Community Edition (CE) vs. Enterprise Edition (EE)
==================================================
Docker is available in two editions: Community Edition (CE)
and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Docker Community Edition (CE) is ideal for developers and
small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting
with container-based apps.  Docker CE has two update channels,
stable and edge:

o Stable gives you reliable updates every quarter
o Edge gives you new features every month

For more information about Docker CE, see Docker Community Edition.[1]

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) is designed for enterprise development
and IT teams who build, ship, and run business critical applications
in production at scale. For more information about Docker EE, including
purchasing options, see Docker Enterprise Edition.[2]
