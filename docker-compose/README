  docker-compose

  Define and run multi-container applications with Docker.

  docker-compose allows you to define a multi-container application with
  all of its dependencies in a single file, then spin the application up
  in a single command. The applicationâ€™s structure and configuration are
  held in a single place, which makes spinning up applications simple and
  repeatable everywhere.
