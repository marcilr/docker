docker-compose

Define and run multi-container applications with Docker.

docker-compose allows you to define a multi-container application with
all of its dependencies in a single file, then spin the application up
in a single command. The application’s structure and configuration are
held in a single place, which makes spinning up applications simple and
repeatable everywhere.

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications.  With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your
application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and
start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about
all the features of Compose, see the list of features.[1]

Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development,
testing, as well as CI workflows.  You can learn more about each case
in Common Use Cases.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:
1. Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.

2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml
   so they can be run together in an isolated environment.

3. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your
   entire app.
