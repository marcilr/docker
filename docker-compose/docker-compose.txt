docker-compose

Use to set up resources.  Simple and easy to use.
Just run 'docker-compose' to display list of commands.


Ruby on Rails
rubyonrails.org/


Define and run multi-container applications with Docker.

docker-compose allows you to define a multi-container application with
all of its dependencies in a single file, then spin the application up
in a single command. The application’s structure and configuration are
held in a single place, which makes spinning up applications simple and
repeatable everywhere.
--man 


Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications.  With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your
application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and
start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about
all the features of Compose, see the list of features.[1]

Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development,
testing, as well as CI workflows.  You can learn more about each case
in Common Use Cases.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:
1. Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.

2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml
   so they can be run together in an isolated environment.

3. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your
   entire app.

Commands (mentioned by Hanh)
========
docker-compose up   - Create and start containers
                      Runs in forground.
                      Logs to stdout
                      Use ctrl-c to shutdown

docker-compose down - Stop and remove containers, networks,
                      images, and volumes


docker-compose build web   - Thinking I may no longer need to do this
                             since Hanh's last modifications circa 
                             Wed Jan 23, 2017.

docker-compose run web /bin/bash
  Thinking I may no longer have to use this comand. 

docker-compose run web rails new . --force --skip-active-record
  Thinking I may no longer have to use this comand.

On Wed Jan 23, 2017 (from chekcing up arrow on Fri Jan 26, 2018):
  xcode-select --install
  fine . -name container_linux.go
  locate container_linux.go
  sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist

=============================
Think Hanh had metioned:

Ruby on Rails
rubyonrails.org/

Run command:
  "Rails Generator"
  "Rails 5" generator   <=== Latest stable

Attach to web server:
  docker-compose run web /bin/bash

echo test >> development.log   <=== Don't remember doing this

rails console   <=== debugger

> Date .parse('2018-03-15')  <=== Test in realtime

iterm  <=== shell terminal
  Shell > Split Vertically with Current Profile  <=== Split terminal vertically
  cmd-option right/left arrow key to select vertical window

docker-compose build web
docker-compose up

Delete vendor/bundle from the PSAP project.   <===
  The project should fetch all gems.
  Should branch and do this.

To start and access ruby on rails (tested Fri Jan 26, 2018):
  docker-compose build web
  docker-compose up
  localhost:3000   <=== Hit ruby on rails on MacBook Pro

Development strategy:
  1. Focus on creating a new ruby class for TCS client code
  2. Test class with 'rails console' the web.

Must Jira Ticket
  TCS Ticket
  "TCS Client" ticket
  The create subtickets for subtasks

o Hanh with sent workflow fro prepaid task.  <=== Should adapt.
o Kanban will build automatically from subtasks.
o Do test driven development
o See Ruby on Rails
o Build unit tests.  i.e. can create tests before development

ctrl-c to break out of docker
docker-compose down
docker system prune   <=== Get rid of orphan files and such

localhost:3000   <=== Rails !!!
