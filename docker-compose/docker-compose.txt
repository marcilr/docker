docker-compose - Define and run multi-container applications with
                 Docker.

docker-compose allows you to define a multi-container application with
all of its dependencies in a single file, then spin the application up
in a single command. The applicationâ€™s structure and configuration are
held in a single place, which makes spinning up applications simple and
repeatable everywhere.
