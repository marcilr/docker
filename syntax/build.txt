docker build


The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile and
a context.  The build’s context is the set of files at a specified
location PATH or URL.  The PATH is a directory on your local
filesystem. The URL is a Git repository location.

A context is processed recursively.  So, a PATH includes any
subdirectories and the URL includes the repository and its
submodules.  This example shows a build command that uses the
current directory as context:

  $ docker build .
  Sending build context to Docker daemon  6.51 MB
  ...

The build is run by the Docker daemon, not by the CLI.  The
first thing a build process does is send the entire context
(recursively) to the daemon.  In most cases, it’s best to
start with an empty directory as context and keep your
Dockerfile in that directory.  Add only the files needed for
building the Dockerfile.

Warning: Do not use your root directory, /, as the PATH as
         it causes the build to transfer the entire contents
         of your hard drive to the Docker daemon.

To use a file in the build context, the Dockerfile refers to
the file specified in an instruction, for example, a COPY
instruction.  To increase the build’s performance, exclude
files and directories by adding a .dockerignore file to the
context directory.[1]
