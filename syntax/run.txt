From work on Call Coverage Interface for location PSAP routing
using Comtech API [ID 187] (psap project) with Hanh Bui on
Wed Dec 13, 2017.


Execute on MacBook Pro under ~/projects/psap/:
  $ docker-compose run web rails new . --force --skip-active-record

Think the --skip-active-record alleviates use of database.
