Docker runs processes in isolated containers.  A container
is a process which runs on a host.  The host may be local
or remote.  When an operator executes docker run, the
container process that runs is isolated in that it has its
own file system, its own networking, and its own isolated
process tree separate from the host.

From work on Call Coverage Interface for location PSAP routing
using Comtech API [ID 187] (psap project) with Hanh Bui on
Wed Dec 13, 2017.


Execute on MacBook Pro under ~/projects/psap/:
  $ docker-compose run web rails new . --force --skip-active-record

Think the --skip-active-record alleviates use of database.
