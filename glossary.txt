Glossary


CI workflows - 

docker - Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins
    to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on
    laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
    --Docker
      https://www.docker.com/

Dockerfile - Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so
    it can be reproduced anywhere.
    --Overview of Docker Compose
      https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/

docker-compose - docker-compose allows you to define a
    multi-container application with all of its dependencies
    in a single file, then spin the application up in a single
    command. The application’s structure and configuration are
    held in a single place, which makes spinning up applications
    simple and repeatable everywhere.
    --man (docker-compose v1.8.0)
