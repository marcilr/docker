Glossary


CI workflows - 

container - A container is a runtime instance of an image–what
  the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image
  with state, or a user process).  You can see a list of your
  running containers with the command, docker ps, just as yo
  would in Linux.
  --Get Started, Part 1: Orientation and setup
    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

docker - Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins
    to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on
    laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
    --Docker
      https://www.docker.com/

Docker Community Edition (CE) - Docker Community Edition (CE) is
    ideal for developers and small teams looking to get started
    with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps.
    Docker CE has two update channels, stable and edge:
    o Stable gives you reliable updates every quarter
    o Edge gives you new features every month
    https://www.docker.com/community-edition/
    --Install Docker
      https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) - Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)
    is designed for enterprise development and IT teams who build,
    ship, and run business critical applications in production at
    scale. 
    https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition/
    --Install Docker
      https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

Dockerfile - Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so
    it can be reproduced anywhere.
    --Overview of Docker Compose
      https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/

docker-compose - docker-compose allows you to define a
    multi-container application with all of its dependencies
    in a single file, then spin the application up in a single
    command. The application’s structure and configuration are
    held in a single place, which makes spinning up applications
    simple and repeatable everywhere.
    --man (docker-compose v1.8.0)

docker-compose.yml - is where the magic happens.  This file
    describes the services that comprise your app (a database
    and a web app), how to get each one’s Docker image (the
    database just runs on a pre-made PostgreSQL image, and the
    web app is built from the current directory), and the
    configuration needed to link them together and expose the
    web app’s port.
