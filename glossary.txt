    laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.

    with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps.

    o Stable gives you reliable updates every quarter
    o Edge gives you new features every month

    is designed for enterprise development and IT teams who build,
    ship, and run business critical applications in production at

    --Overview of Docker Compose
      https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/

docker-compose - docker-compose allows you to define a
    multi-container application with all of its dependencies
    in a single file, then spin the application up in a single
    command. The application’s structure and configuration are
    held in a single place, which makes spinning up applications
    simple and repeatable everywhere.
    --man (docker-compose v1.8.0)
