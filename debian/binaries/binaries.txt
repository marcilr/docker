Binaries


There is no official support of docker in Ubuntu 17.04 yet.
An alternative is to download and install the binary of
docker from https://github.com/moby/moby/releases.

For example if you want to install docker version
17.04.0-ce from binary, follow these steps:

$ wget https://get.docker.com/builds/Linux/x86_64/docker-17.04.0-ce.tgz
$ tar xzvf docker-17.04.0-ce.tgz
$ cd docker

This docker directory contains all the binaries.  You need
to add this directory to your PATH.  You will need to
manually start dockerd first.  This page[2] contains more
details about how to install and run docker from a binary.[1]
