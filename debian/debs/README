  Docker CE

  Description: Docker: the open-source application container engine
  Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run any application as a
  lightweight container
  .
  Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
  they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and
  everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular
  language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks
  for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without
  depending on a particular stack or provider.
